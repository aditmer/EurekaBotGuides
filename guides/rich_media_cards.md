### What are [rich media cards](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/bot-builder-howto-add-media-attachments?view=azure-bot-service-4.0&tabs=csharp)?

Messages exchanged between user and bot can contain media attachments, such as images, video, audio, and files. The Bot Framework SDK supports the task of sending rich messages to the user.
